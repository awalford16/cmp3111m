Software Engineering Assignment

## Program Requirements 
The program depends on the following packages:

Package Name | Purpose
--- | ---
Tkinter | Render UI
newsapi-python | Getting news articles
spotipy | Getting list of spotify songs

Install the required packages using the command

```python
python3 -m pip install [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

## Runnning the Program
To run the program you run the main.py file. The program will not run as the API keys are not stored in this Git Repository as it is not a safe practice.

The program currently takes the top news headings from the week, selects a random work of greater than 3 letter length and creates a spotify playlist based on these words.
